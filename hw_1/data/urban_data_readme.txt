## Title: Native and exotic plant and bird species found in global cities


Summary: These data describe plant and bird species observed in cities around the world based on published vegetation surveys collected since 1950 and standardized bird surveys conducted since 1990 from within city administrative boundaries. These data were used in Aronson et al. 2014 to analyze differences in native and exotic bird and plant diversity across 147 global cities.


## Description of the data and file structure

Data are provided as a CSV file with 8 column variables and 147 row observations corresponding to individual cities. NA values indicate data for this variable was not available for this city (i.e. not all cities have data for both birds and plants). Bird species were designated 'exotic' or 'native' to each city based on BirdLife International range maps, and plant species were designated 'exotic' or 'native' to each city after consulting literature and experts from each region.

Column variable descriptions:
city: Name of city
country: Name of country
total_bird: Total number of bird species observed in a city from 1990- (combined exotic and native)
exotic_bird: Number of exotic bird species observed in a city from 1990-
native_bird: Number of native bird species observed in a city from 1990-
total_plant: Total number of plant species observed in a city from 1950- (combined exotic and native)
exotic_plant: Number of exotic plant species observed in a city from 1950-
native_plant: Number of native plant species observed in a city from 1950-
