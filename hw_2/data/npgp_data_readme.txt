## Title: Floating plastic and neuston in the North Pacific Garbage Patch
---

Summary: These data describe measurements of plastics and neustonic (floating) organisms collected by 54 surface ocean Manta trawls in the North Pacific Garbage Patch (NPGP) during two expeditions in August 2015 and December 2019. Trawl contents (plastics, biological specimens, etc.) were classified, counted, and distinguished by size (plastics only, classes between 5mm-5cm). These data were originally published by Egger et al. (2021) and have been subset for instructional purposes.



## Description of the data and file structure

Data are provided as a CSV file with 22 columns and 54 row observations corresponding to individual Manta trawl deployments. Non-zero blank/NA cells for plastic and specimen concentrations refer to cases in which the limit of detection was not met. Reported zeroes indicate limit of detection was exceeded but no individuals were observed.

Column variable descriptions:

Sample_ID:	unique sample identifier associated with a particular Manta trawl deployment
Expedition:	one of two expeditions, NPM3 or MEGA, during which samples were collected
Area:		area where sample was collected defined by modeled numerical concentrations of floating plastic debris; A="low" or <10^4 #/sq km, B="moderate" or 10^4-10^5 #/sq km, C="high" or >10^5 #/sq km), see Figure 1
Time_of_day:	time of day (day or night) when sample was collected
Trawled_area:	estimate of area in square kilometers over which sample was collected based on distance measurements from a mechanical flow meter (General Oceanics) and trawl net mouth area
LOD:		limit of detection defined as individuals/particles per square kilometer, value below which concentration could not be accurately measured
Plastic_uncorrected:	concentration of plastic particles (all size classes) per square kilometer, uncorrected for wind-induced turbulent mixing
V.velella:	concentration of V. vellela per square kilometer
Halobates.spp:	concentration of Halobates species per square kilometer
J.janthina:	concentration of J. janthina per square kilometer
P.porpita:	concentration of P. porpita per square kilometer
P.physalis:	concentration of P. physalis per square kilometer
Glaucus.spp:	concentration of Glaucus species per square kilometer
Copepods:	concentration of copepods per square kilometer
Amphipods:	concentration of amphipods per square kilometer
Pteropods:	concentration of pteropods per square kilometer
Isopods:	concentration of isopods per square kilometer
Heteropods:	concentration of heteropods per square kilometer
Crabs:	concentration of crabs per square kilometer
Squid:	concentration of squid per square kilometer
Euphausiids.shrimps:	concentration of euphausiids/shrimps per square kilometer
Fish:	concentration of fish per square kilometer
